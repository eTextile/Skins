## The timbre space 

The timbre space example requires GEM for plotting.

You'll also need folder_list and split_file from the hcs library in Pd-extended.

- Hcs
  - folder_list
  - split_file

I haven't written complete instructions on how to use everything in this patch yet,
but once you've analyzed your sounds, click the "rendering" toggle to generate a gemwin.
Then click the "Plot" button and check the "Mouseover" toggle to enable sound playback when you mouse over any point.
Increase the mouse radius slider to make the mouse's range of influence a lot wider.
Use the zoom and offset controls to navigate to specific parts of the plot and get a more detailed look.
To assign different features to the X and Y axes, just click the radio buttons at the top of each patch.
You can also try plotting in 3 dimensions and rotate the space to get a better look at things.
Mouse-over audio browsing is only possible in 2 dimensions though.
